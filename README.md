# HistoricalEmotionAnalysis

This is the repository of my master's thesis "Computational Linguistics Approaches to Historical Emotion Analysis: Evaluating Word Embeddings, Induction Algorithms, and Lexicon Choice."

Note that (1) the following data could not be included due to size constraints:
- for Section 4.1 (Preprocessing): the preprocessed corpora, the trained embeddings
- for Section 4.3 (Investigating Lexicon Size): the randomly generated seed word lexica, the predicted historical vad lexica

Note that (2) the COHA could not be included as it is not open data. I did include an 'Example Corpus' and example preprocessed data, so the code can be tested. But, of course, one cannot recreate my findings with these data alone.

Note that (3), if you decide to retrain the embeddings yourself, results will vary slightly due to the non-deterministic nature of SGNS, CBOW, and FastText. While some outcomes in 4.2 and 4.3 may change, my central findings of 4.4 (discussed in 5.) still hold true.
